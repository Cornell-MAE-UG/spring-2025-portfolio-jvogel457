While simultaneously serving as mechanical lead, overseeing the design of our 2026 Urban Concept car, I took on a project of my own - the Steering Mounting Plate. While not a particularly exciting name, this project was crucial to the steering system. It provides a flat mounting surface for the rack and pinion, brake pedal, acceleration pedal, and autonomous driving hardware. 

The plate was laser cut out of 1/4" aluminum. Weight was a huge concern with this project since it covers almost 400 square inches. Without any weight-savings, it would weight close to 10 pounds. Using ANSYS Mechanical in combination with hand calculations for load cases I defined, I was able to cut out sections of the plate, reducing its overall weight by almost 50%. These simulations, which are pictured above, allowed me to create a plate that is lightweight while still being strong enough to avoid any huge deformation.
