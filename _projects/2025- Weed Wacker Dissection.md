As a final project for MAE 3230: Introductory Fluid Mechanics, we were asked to take apart a fluid mechanical device and make a video explaining how it works using principles from the class. My group was assigned a weed wacker. In order to make this project, we had to take apart the device, record observations and measurements, perform calculations, write a script, and finally film and edit the video together. I personally performed many of the calculations, finding the pressure drop at the throat of the carbeurator and viscous losses in the fuel pipe. I aslo presented these slides in the final video. Lastly, I edited the clips together, since my group found it easier to record our parts separately and then stitch them together later.
