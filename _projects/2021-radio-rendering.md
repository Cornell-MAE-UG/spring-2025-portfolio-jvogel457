For MAE 2250: Mechanical Design, we were asked to design a product to solve a particular problem. In order to combat dehydration, my group made HydroClip. HydroClip is an innovative water bottle holder that allows you to mount your water bottle to the front of your backpack strap instead of in the typical water bottle pocket. That way, the waterbottle is always in reach and there is no need to awkardly hunch over or take your backpack off in order to have a drink of water. It is perfect for anyone from hikers to college students -- anyone on the go. 

For this product to work, there were a couple of metrics we had to achieve. To start, our device had to be able to grip onto the user's backpack strap and stay firmy in place. We solved this challenge with our mounting mechanism which is a set of custom fabricated clips on the back of the procuct. 

The other main functionality we had to achieve is ease of use. The user needs to be able to take their water bottle out easily, while still keeping it stable while not in use. To solve this issue, we made a buckle-like mechanism that locks the water bottle into place. To retrieve the water bottle, the user simply pushes on the outer tabs and the water bottle springs into action. 

Lastly, we wanted this poduct to be accesible. To make HydroClip the perfect product for a wide variety of people, we sourced a water bottle holder that can accomodate water bottles ranging from 2 inches to 4 inches in diameter. The water bottle holder, originally designed for a bicycle, is rigid, yet flexible, which is perfect for our purposes.
