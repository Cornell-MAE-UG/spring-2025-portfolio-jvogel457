As part of MAE 3270: Mechanics of Materials, we were tasked with designing a torque wrench. The project involved creating a MATLAB script to run calculations to check the design against failure in strength, fracture, and fatigue. There were also requirements placed on sensitivity, since the goal of this wrench is to measure torque using data from a strain gauge. After creating a baseline design, ANSYS Mechanical was used to verfiy the hand calculations and check for any other stress concentrations that were not captured in the hand calculations.
