In the spring of 2024, I was tasked with creating the autonomous steering system for my project team, Cornell Electric Vehicles. Over the next year and a half, I designed, manufactured, and began testing my system. The system consists of a motor, an electromagnetic clutch, a gearbox, and a modified shaft.

The motor creates the original rotary motion that will eventually turn the steering wheel.

The EM Clutch couples the motion of the motor to the gearbox with a set of current controlled magnets. As both a safety requirement and a matter of convenience, the motor and gearbox can be disengaged by turning off the current in the EM clutch. 

The gearbox increases the torque of the motor using a series of gears. The total gear ratio of the gearbox is around 17, which is more than sufficient to turn the steering wheel. 

The gearbox is connected to the steering column, which is a custom hexagonal shaft, by a pulley. The shaft was machined on the lathe to have a variety of different cross sections. By actuating the steering column, the car's wheels turn.
