To model this thermos, I first started by sketching a modified rectangle with one side matching the curve of the main black cylinder. Then I revolved this to produce the main part of the thermos. To add the metal rings at the top and bottom, I projected the geometry from the top and bottom faces and extruded them. The lid started in a similar fashion, but to make the offset part, I had to construct a plane at an angle and take cuts away from the solid lid. The rectangular indentation at the top was an extrusion from that same plane and the switch was made using the same geometry. I extruded circles away from the switch to make the curved thumb grip. Then I used the emboss tool to make the letters on the outside.

The hardest part of this whole process was definitely the tilted lid. If I were to do this again, I think I might use the loft feature instead. That way I could just sketch the top and bottom profiles of the inclined part of the lid and connect them. I think I can also improve on my organization in CAD, since at times it was hard to find the right sketch to modify. I also want to experiment with more parametrized designs in the future so I do not have to remodel everything when one dimension changes.
