As part of MAE 3780: Mechatronics, I built an autonomous robot designed to collect cubes during a 60 second match. The robot uses 2 H-bridges and an Arduino to control the direction of its two wheels. It collects cubes with a gravity deployed arm that falls down at the beginning of the match. The arm is made out of laser cut acrylic.
